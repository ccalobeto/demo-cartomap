# Using styles in your project
## Copy a new style
Copy the style to test from [repo](https://github.com/ccalobeto/publishing-pmtile/tree/main/static/data/styles)

## Use the style

Go to *static/data/styles* and edit the `url` key with your recent pmtile location in `Public R2.dev Bucket URL`. Then in `src/routes/+page.svelte` of your other project edit the path of the recent custom style. Finally edit the initial coordinates.
